Lab: Configure Basic Router Settings
Background / Scenario
This lab reviews IOS router commands by completing basic router and interface configurations and verifying connectivity. It also demonstrates SSH access and using IOS commands to retrieve router information.

Part 1: Set Up the Topology and Initialize Devices
Step 1: Cable the network as shown in the topology.
On Physical Devices:
Attach the devices (router, switch, PCs) as shown in the topology diagram using appropriate cables.
Power on all devices.
Step 2: Initialize and reload the router and switch.
On the Router and Switch (via Console):
Erase the startup configuration:
bash
Copy
Edit
erase startup-config
Reload the devices:
bash
Copy
Edit
reload
Part 2: Configure Devices and Verify Connectivity
Step 1: Configure the PC Interfaces.
On PC-A and PC-B:
Assign the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway using the network settings in your operating system.
Step 2: Configure the Router.
Console into the Router (from PC-A):

Open the terminal (e.g., Tera Term) and connect to the router via the console port.
Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable
Enter Configuration Mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
config terminal
Perform Router Configuration:

Set hostname:
bash
Copy
Edit
hostname R1
Set domain name:
bash
Copy
Edit
ip domain name ccna-lab.com
Disable DNS lookup:
bash
Copy
Edit
no ip domain lookup
Encrypt plaintext passwords:
bash
Copy
Edit
service password-encryption
Set a minimum password length:
bash
Copy
Edit
security passwords min-length 12
Create an admin user with an encrypted password:
bash
Copy
Edit
username SSHadmin secret 55Hadm!n2020
Generate RSA keys for SSH (1024 bits):
bash
Copy
Edit
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
Set the privileged EXEC password:
bash
Copy
Edit
enable secret $cisco!PRIV*
Configure console password and inactivity timeout:
bash
Copy
Edit
line console 0
password $cisco!!CON*
exec-timeout 4 0
login
exit
Configure VTY lines for SSH:
bash
Copy
Edit
line vty 0 4
password $cisco!!VTY*
exec-timeout 4 0
transport input ssh
login local
exit
Set a login banner:
bash
Copy
Edit
banner motd $ Authorized Users Only! $
Enable IPv6 routing:
bash
Copy
Edit
ipv6 unicast-routing
Configure interfaces with IP addresses and descriptions:
bash
Copy
Edit
interface g0/0/0
ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad::1/64
description Connection to PC-B
no shutdown
exit

interface g0/0/1
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:1::1/64
description Connection to S1
no shutdown
exit

interface loopback0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
ipv6 address fe80::1 link-local
ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:2::1/64
description loopback adapter
no shutdown
exit
Block VTY logins after failed attempts:
bash
Copy
Edit
login block-for 120 attempts 3 within 60
Set the clock:
bash
Copy
Edit
clock set 15:20:00 5 Sept 2019
Save the running configuration:
bash
Copy
Edit
copy running-config startup-config
Question: What happens if the router is reloaded before saving the configuration?
Answer: The running configuration in RAM will be erased. The router will boot without a startup configuration, prompting the initial configuration dialog.

Step 3: Verify Network Connectivity.
On PC-A Command Line:

Ping PC-B's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.0.X
ping [2001:db8:acad::X]
Answer: Were the pings successful?
Yes.
Access Router Remotely via SSH:

Use Tera Term on PC-A to SSH into R1's loopback interface IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Login credentials:
Username: SSHadmin
Password: 55Hadm!n2020
Answer: Was remote access successful?
Yes.
Question: Why is Telnet considered a security risk?
Answer: Telnet sessions are not encrypted, and passwords can be intercepted using packet sniffers.

Part 3: Display Router Information
Step 1: Establish an SSH Session to R1.
From PC-B, open an SSH session to the R1 IPv6 Loopback Interface.
Step 2: Retrieve Router Information.
Use the show version command:
bash
Copy
Edit
show version
Key Output:
Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 16.9.4
System image file: flash:isr4200-universalk9_ias.16.09.04.SPA.bin
Last reload reason: PowerOn
